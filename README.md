# Welcome to My First Ever Repository!

## ðŸŒŸ Thank you for joining me from Twitter

In this space, I aim to share the code behind my charts. The philosophy here is simple: **"Don't trust, verify!"** By providing you with the tools and code used in my analyses, I encourage you to explore, run, and verify the data yourself.

## What's Inside?

### Analysis: Simulating the Performance of a US$1,000 Portfolio Over a Decade

This repository kicks off with a fascinating analysis:

- **Simulating the Performance of a $1,000 Portfolio Over a Decade, Adjusting for Bitcoin's Best Days.**

By simulating the performance of a $1,000 portfolio, we uncover the impact of being present (or absent) during Bitcoin's significant price movements. Hopefully, it becomes clear that timing the market isn't the best strategy with Bitcoin.

## Your Feedback is Invaluable

Feedback, suggestions, and contributions are warmly welcomed. If you have ideas for improving the analysis or have conducted similar work, let's collaborate!

## Stay Tuned for More!

This is just the beginning. I plan to regularly update this repository with more analyses, insights, and tools to empower you to become your own analyst.

### Enjoy your journey through data and analysis!
